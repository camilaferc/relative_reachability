<kbd><img src="/images/rramen.png" /></kbd>

---

RRAMEN is an interactive tool that supports different city-scale mobility-related queries by different types of users with different needs. RRAMEN is based on the concept of Relative Reachability, and its main goal is to aid individual users and urban planners in making informed choices and evaluating changes w.r.t. a city's transportation network. 

### 1. Examples & Usage

#### a. Individual Users

#### b. Urban Planners

### 2. Installation & Setup
#### a. Datasets
In order to solve RR queries, RRAMEN requires the following datasets for a given region of interest.
##### OSM Map
RRAMEN uses OSM maps ([https://www.openstreetmap.org/](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)) in order to model a city's road network.
After downloading an OSM map for a given region, the `.osm` file must be placed in `data/osm/<region-name>/<osm-file>`.
